# Instructions

1. Fork this repository into your own GitHub account.

2. Look at `assignment.js`. Following the instructions about what you can
   change, add or fix the code to make the tests pass.

3. I recommend committing your work every time you finish a session, and pushing
   it up to GitHub.

4. At some point, generate a PR back to me. Your work needn't be finished: if
   you push more commits to your account after creating a PR, they'll
   automatically get merged in (assuming you stay in the same branch).
